# Support Assistant - Create App Plan Implementation

This project implements the foundational architecture for the Support Assistant application as outlined in the `create-app-plan` assignment.

```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components Implemented

1. **AI Service (`IAIService`)** - Handles ONNX Runtime integration and AI inference
2. **Knowledge Base Service (`IKnowledgeBaseService`)** - Manages document processing and chunking
3. **Vector Store Service (`IVectorStoreService`)** - Local vector storage for RAG implementation
4. **Configuration Service (`IConfigurationService`)** - Application settings and configuration

### UI Framework

- **Avalonia UI** with MVVM pattern using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- **MainWindow** with collapsible settings panel
- **ChatViewModel** for user interaction
- **SettingsViewModel** for configuration management

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Project Structure**: Multi-project solution with proper separation of concerns
✅ **Dependency Injection**: Service registration and DI container setup
✅ **ONNX Runtime Integration**: DirectML provider support with CPU fallback
✅ **MVVM Architecture**: Observable properties and relay commands
✅ **Configuration System**: JSON-based settings with default values
✅ **Basic UI Layout**: Main chat interface with settings panel
✅ **Unit Tests**: Basic test coverage for core services
✅ **Build System**: Successful compilation and test execution

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 9.0** - Latest .NET framework
- **Avalonia UI 11.1.0** - Cross-platform UI framework
- **ONNX Runtime with DirectML** - AI inference with GPU acceleration
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** - MVVM implementation
- **XUnit** - Unit testing framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Windows 10/11 (for DirectML support)
- Compatible GPU (optional, falls back to CPU)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Run the application (requires display)
dotnet run --project src/SupportAssistant.UI
```

## Implementation Status

This represents **Phase 1** of the implementation plan: **Core Setup & Knowledge Base Preparation**

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Project initialization with Avalonia framework
- [x] ONNX Runtime and DirectML integration setup
- [x] Service interfaces and basic implementations
- [x] MVVM ViewModels and Views structure
- [x] Dependency injection configuration
- [x] Basic unit tests
- [x] Configuration management system

### Next Phase (Phase 2): AI Service & RAG Implementation

- [ ] Actual ONNX model loading and inference
- [ ] Embedding model integration
- [ ] RAG pipeline implementation
- [ ] Vector similarity search
- [ ] Prompt construction and response generation

### Future Phases

- **Phase 3**: Full UI/UX implementation with working chat interface
- **Phase 4**: Agentic capabilities and system modification tools

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Local-First**: All processing happens on-device for privacy and cost efficiency
2. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between UI, Core logic, and Data layers
3. **Dependency Injection**: Facilitates testing and maintainability
4. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations for responsive UI
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Easy customization without code changes

## Known Limitations

- Model files are simulated (actual ONNX models need to be provided)
- Vector search uses simple keyword matching (will be replaced with embeddings)
- UI is simplified placeholder (full chat interface in next phase)
- File dialogs are not implemented (require platform-specific code)
