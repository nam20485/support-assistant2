# Support Assistant - Comprehensive Application Development Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**SupportAssistant** is a free, open-source Windows desktop application designed to provide intelligent technical support using local AI. The application leverages a Small Language Model (SLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver contextual assistance while maintaining complete user privacy through on-device processing.

### Key Features

- **📚 Knowledge Base RAG**: Search curated technical documentation for accurate solutions  
- **🔧 Agentic Capabilities**: Execute system modifications with explicit user consent
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All processing occurs locally - no data leaves the device
- **💻 Cross-Platform UI**: Built with Avalonia for potential future macOS/Linux support
- **📱 Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet connectivity

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: C# with Avalonia UI (MVVM pattern)
- **AI Runtime**: ONNX Runtime with DirectML execution provider
- **Model**: Microsoft Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct (INT4 quantized, ~2.4GB)
- **Target Platform**: Windows 10/11 (x64 and ARM64)
- **License**: MIT License (open source)
